# Boagent

Local API / sidecar / companion of a running application that computes and gives insights to the application regarding its environmental impacts. If no parameters are passed to the API to isolate the application, then the impact of the whole machine is calculated.

## How to use

This is an API, you could use either your browser, curl, or call it directly from an application (which is the main usecase).

Once the API is running, a Swagger interface is available on localhost:8000/docs.

To run it :

```
cd boagent/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd api/
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

The app can run without root privileges, but you won't get full data about the RAM and get some warnings.
Run as root to have the best evaluation possible.

## How to setup

### BoaviztAPI

You need to build the BoaviztAPI container image, then run the container locally on port 5000.

Look at the BoaviztAPI for the setup.

### BoaviztaAPI SDK

Once the BoaviztAPI is running, the generate.sh script will download the new openapi.json definition and generate the client lib :

```
cd impact
bash generate.sh
```

Generate and install the lib as a pip package :

```
cd impact/python-client
bash build.sh
```

### Scaphandre TO BE IMPROVED

To get power consumption metrics, you need scaphandre runnig in the background, with the json exporter. This will write power metrics to a file, that Boagent will read :

```
scaphandre json -s 5 -f power_data.json
```

## Deeper explanations

### Environmental metrics

This project uses the Life Cycle Assessment (ISO 14040 / 14044) methodology as a reference.

This way, it is intended to evaluate the impacts on all life cycle phases (extraction, manufacturing, shipping, use, end of life). **Today we only evaluate manufacturing and use phases.**

Here are the impacts considered so far :

- Green House Gaz emissions / Global Warming Potential (see GHG protocol as a reference)
    - resources extraction (LCA) / scope 3 (GHG protocol) ✔️
    - use (LCA) / scope 2 (GHG protocol) ✔️
    - manufacturing (LCA) / scope 3 (GHG protocol) ✔️
    - shipping (LCA) / scope 3 (GHG protocol) ❌
    - end of life (LCA) / scope 3 (GHG protocol) ❌
- Abiotic ressources depletion (minerals), criteria called ADP or Abiotic Depletion Potential
    - resources extraction (LCA) ✔️
    - use (LCA) ✔️
    - manufacturing (LCA) ✔️
    - shipping (LCA) ❌
    - end of life (LCA) ❌
- Primary energy usage : PE
    - resources extraction (LCA) ✔️
    - use (LCA) ✔️
    - manufacturing (LCA) ✔️
    - shipping (LCA) ❌
    - end of life (LCA) ❌
