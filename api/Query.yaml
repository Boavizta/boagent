  version: 1.0.0
  summary: >-
    The query API allows you to determine the environmental footprint for
    different types of scenarios (time-baed or machine-based). 
  description: >-
    Use this API to get the environmental footprint for your any operation
    happening on the server.


    You can use a time-based query in order to get the carbon emissions that
    have been created during the processing of a request or a background
    operation (e.g. making a thumbnail).


    If you simply want the environmental footprint of a running pod or virtual
    machine, from when it started to now (or to when it stopped), you can query
    using the pod or virtual machine identifier.
